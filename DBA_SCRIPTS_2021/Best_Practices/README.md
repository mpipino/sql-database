**BPCheck** - SQL Best Practices and Performance checks

**Purpose:** Checks SQL Server in scope for some of most common skewed Best Practices and performance issues. Valid from SQL Server 2005 onwards. By default all databases in the SQL Server instance are eligible for the several database specific checks, and you may use the optional parameter to narrow these checks to specific databases.

All checks marked with * can be disabled by @ptocheck parameter. Check the PARAMETERS.md file or script header for all usage parameters.

**IMPORTANT pre-requisites:**
- Only a sysadmin/local host admin will be able to perform all checks.
- If you want to perform all checks under non-sysadmin credentials, then that login must be:
  - Member of serveradmin server role or have the ALTER SETTINGS server permission; 
  - Member of MSDB SQLAgentOperatorRole role, or have SELECT permission on the sysalerts table in MSDB;
  - Granted EXECUTE permissions on the following extended sprocs to run checks: spOACreate, spOADestroy, spOAGetErrorInfo, xpenumerrorlogs, xpfileexist and xpregenumvalues;
  - Granted EXECUTE permissions on xp_msver;
  - Granted the VIEW SERVER STATE permission;
  - Granted the VIEW DATABASE STATE permission;
  - A xp_cmdshell proxy account should exist to run checks that access disk or OS security configurations.
  - Member of securityadmin role, or have EXECUTE permissions on sp_readerrorlog. 
  - Otherwise some checks will be bypassed and warnings will be shown.
- Powershell must be installed to run checks that access disk configurations, as well as allow execution of unsigned scripts.
